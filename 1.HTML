<h1>Chinmayananda's teachings about vedas </h1>
<p>The ancient sacred texts of Hinduism are called the Veda, which means “knowledge.” Hindus composed these texts in what is now India over hundreds of years, beginning in about 1500 bce. For a long time they passed down the texts of the Veda by reciting them. Eventually they wrote the texts down. Hindus today still study the Veda</p>
