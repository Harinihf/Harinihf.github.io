<center><h1>Values from vedas </h1></center>
<p><marquee direction="up">The ancient sacred texts of Hinduism are called the Veda, which means knowledge. Hindus composed these texts in what is now India over hundreds of years, beginning in about 1500 bce.<br> For a long time they passed down the texts of the Veda by reciting them. Eventually they wrote the texts down. Hindus today still study the Veda.<br>The concept of 'values' comes from the corporate world. And every corporate world, even the most corrupt, has 'values' printed on its annual general report. This can be traced to the notion of 'commandment' that comes from Abrahamic mythology, where God of Abraham puts down a set of rules (and values, when there are no rules) of how humans are supposed to live their life. This set of rules are transmitted by messengers known as prophets. Sadly, no one is sure what the correct set of rules and values are, and this is why Jewish people fight with Muslims and Muslims fight with Christians. And there are fights between various Jewish, Islamic and Christian subgroups. The 'secular' nation state simply replaces God with 'We, the People' or the 'State' and uses the same model of governance based on a rules/values that everyone is supposed to follow.
